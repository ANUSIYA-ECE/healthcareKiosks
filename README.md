This project presents the design and implementation of a modular, AI-integrated Healthcare Kiosk System tailored for deployment in semi-urban and rural areas across India. The system is developed to perform secure user authentication, collect real-time vital signs, analyze symptoms using AI-driven logic, book medical consultations, and generate as well as retrieve past health reportsâ€”all within a self-contained kiosk environment. To initiate access, the system offers two authentication modes: Face Recognition and Aadhaar-based OTP login. Face recognition is achieved using a combination of Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and the Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) algorithm for identity verification, while the Aadhaar login module validates users through an OTP sent to their registered email using SMTP and random number generation logic.

Upon successful login, users are redirected to an interactive dashboard that integrates four primary services. The first module, Vitals Monitoring, is built using Node.js and evaluates key physiological parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, body temperature, and Body Mass Index (BMI). These values are classified using a rule-based decision system that adapts thresholds based on age and gender, and are stored in structured CSV format. The second module, AI Symptom Checker, is implemented in Python using Flask and operates on curated datasets such as dataset.csv, symptom_severity.csv, and user_vitals.csv. It applies a weighted rule-based inference model to estimate the severity of user-reported symptoms in conjunction with measured vitals. Based on the computed risk level, the system generates a personalized report comprising diagnosis, symptom explanations, recommended precautions, and prescription suggestions. This report is automatically rendered and stored as a downloadable PDF.

The third component of the kiosk is the Book Consultation module, where users can schedule appointments with doctors based on department availability and time slots. This module references time-based availability data (e.g., offline_schedule.csv) to determine valid consultation windows. Finally, the Past Reports module provides access to previously generated health summaries and diagnostic PDFs, enabling continuity of care and retrospective review. All modules interact through structured file systems using CSV and JSON formats, allowing seamless integration between Python and Node.js environments. Designed for offline-first operation, the system ensures data privacy, biometric security, modular extensibility, and efficient performance even on low-resource computing devices, making it a scalable solution for accessible, intelligent healthcare delivery in underserved regions.
